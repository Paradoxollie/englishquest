# Style Guide – EnglishQuest

Design:
- Dark theme overall, with a professional, modern look.
- Background: very dark (near black) with subtle gradients.
- Accent colors: teal/cyan for primary actions, gold for XP and coins.
- Use card components with rounded corners and subtle shadows.

Typography:
- Use a clean, professional sans-serif font such as "Inter" for all text.
- Headings use slightly larger sizes and bolder weight, but no fancy fonts.

MMORPG flavor:
- Use icons and small decorative elements inspired by RPGs (swords, books, crystals), but keep the UI minimal and not childish.
- The site should feel like a serious, modern app for teens and young adults, not like a kids’ website.

Responsiveness:
- Design mobile-first.
- All pages must be fully usable on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
- Use Tailwind responsive utilities (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to stack elements on small screens and use multi-column layouts on larger screens.

Accessibility:
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for text.
- Use semantic HTML (nav, main, header, footer).
- Buttons must be keyboard-focusable and clearly clickable.
